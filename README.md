  ## Description
  This is a way to create a respectable README file simply by answering a few questions from the command line.
  
  ## Installation
  You will need to have a code editor, like VS Code, and you will need Node.js installed on your machine.
  
  1. Clone the repo from GitHub 
  2. Install the node package manager from the command line using `npm init`. 
  3. Install the Inquirer package from the command line using `npm install inquirer`.
  
  ## Usage
  Once software is downloaded and Node packages are initialized, it's time to get started!

  Within the directory for this project, initialize prompts using the command `node index.js`.

  From there, simply enter the necessary information for your project, and voila! A new README file will be generated and placed into     the main directory folder.

  Not sure what to input for a certain section? Follow the guidelines outlined below.
  
  ## Guidelines
  Description: Questions to Consider

  * What is the app for?
  * What was your motivation?
  * Why did you build this project?
  * What problem does it solve?
  * What did you learn?
  * What makes your project stand out?
  
  Installation: What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
  
  Usage: Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

  Licenses: This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use https://choosealicense.com/

  Contributing: If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

  Questions: Include your GitHub profile and email so users can reach out to you with any questions about your project.

  Credits: List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. Don't forget to include your own name!
  If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence.
